# âš¾ MLB Player Data Analysis â€” SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project simulates the role of a **Data Analyst for Major League Baseball (MLB)**. The goal was to explore and analyze comprehensive historical data about MLB playersâ€”ranging from their educational background to salary trends, career trajectories, and player physical attributes.

This project applies **advanced SQL techniques** like CTEs, window functions, aggregations, and joins to extract and summarize meaningful insights that could support decision-making in player scouting, salary structuring, and performance analytics.
